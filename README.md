# Predicting House Prices - Advanced-Regression
## Introduction
In this repository, our goal is to predict the monetary value of homes in Boston suburbs
<br />
We will use several ML algorithms and evaluate their performance and predictive power in order to come up with a 'best fit' model trained on data collected from homes located in the suburbans of Boston. 
<br />The dataset is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. Note that every record will describe a Boston suburb or a town
