# Predicting Housing Prices - Advanced-Regression
In this repository, we will build and evaluate the performance and predictive power of a 'best fit' model trained on data collected from homes located in the suburbans of Boston. The dataset is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. Note that every record will describe a Boston suburb or a town
